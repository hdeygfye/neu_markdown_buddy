The `tracemalloc` module is a built-in tool that provides support for tracing memory allocation events. It can help identify memory leaks and optimize memory usage by analyzing how memory is allocated and deallocated over time.

Here are some code examples demonstrating the usage of the `tracemalloc` module:

### 1. Enabling Tracing

```python
import tracemalloc

# Start tracing memory allocations
tracemalloc.start()
```

### 2. Capturing Memory Snapshot

```python
import tracemalloc

# Start tracing memory allocations
tracemalloc.start()

# Perform some memory-intensive operations
# For example, create a large list of dictionaries
large_list = [{} for _ in range(1000)]

# Stop tracing and capture a snapshot
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
```

### 3. Analyzing Memory Snapshot

```python
import tracemalloc

# Start tracing memory allocations
tracemalloc.start()

# Perform some memory-intensive operations
# For example, create a large list of dictionaries
large_list = [{} for _ in range(1000)]

# Stop tracing and capture a snapshot
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()

# Print the top 5 most common allocations
top_stats = snapshot.statistics('lineno')
for stat in top_stats[:5]:
    print(stat)
```

### 4. Analyzing Top Memory Usage

```python
import tracemalloc

# Start tracing memory allocations
tracemalloc.start()

# Perform some memory-intensive operations
# For example, create a large list of dictionaries
large_list = [{} for _ in range(1000)]

# Stop tracing and capture a snapshot
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()

# Print the top 5 most common allocations by size
top_stats = snapshot.statistics('size')
for stat in top_stats[:5]:
    print(stat)
```

### 5. Analyzing Memory Usage Over Time

```python
import tracemalloc

# Start tracing memory allocations
tracemalloc.start()

# Perform some memory-intensive operations over time
large_list = []
for _ in range(10):
    large_list.append([{} for _ in range(1000)])

# Stop tracing and capture a snapshot
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()

# Print the top 5 most common allocations by size at each step
top_stats = snapshot.statistics('size')
for stat in top_stats:
    print(stat)
```

### 6. Writing Results to File

```python
import tracemalloc

# Start tracing memory allocations
tracemalloc.start()

# Perform some memory-intensive operations
large_list = [{} for _ in range(1000)]

# Stop tracing and capture a snapshot
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()

# Write the top 5 most common allocations to a file
with open('memory_stats.txt', 'w') as f:
    stats = snapshot.statistics('lineno')
    for stat in stats[:5]:
        f.write(f"{stat.lineno}:{stat.count} bytes\n")
```

### 7. Resetting Tracing

```python
import tracemalloc

# Start tracing memory allocations
tracemalloc.start()

# Perform some memory-intensive operations
large_list = [{} for _ in range(1000)]

# Stop tracing and capture a snapshot
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()

# Reset tracing to start fresh
tracemalloc.reset_peak()
```

### 8. Using with Context Manager

```python
import tracemalloc

with tracemalloc.start():
    # Perform some memory-intensive operations
    large_list = [{} for _ in range(1000)]

# Stop tracing after the context manager exits
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()

# Print the top 5 most common allocations by size
top_stats = snapshot.statistics('size')
for stat in top_stats[:5]:
    print(stat)
```

These examples demonstrate various functionalities of the `tracemalloc` module, including starting and stopping tracing, capturing snapshots, analyzing memory usage, writing results to a file, resetting tracing, and using the module with a context manager. Each example includes comments for clarity.
