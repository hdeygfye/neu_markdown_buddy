The `chunk` module is not a standard library module in Python. It appears to be a fictional or hypothetical module for demonstrating purposes, as there is no actual `chunk` module available in Python's standard library. However, I can provide examples of how you might work with IFF (Interleaved File Format) data, which is often used for audio and image files.

IFF is a file format that uses chunks to store different types of data within the same file. The `chunk` module would typically be used to extract or manipulate these chunks from an IFF file.

Here are some example code snippets that demonstrate how you might read and process IFF files in Python:

### Example 1: Reading IFF Audio File (using a fictional `chunk` module)

Assume we have a fictional `chunk` module that provides functions to interact with IFF files. This is just for demonstration purposes.

```python
import chunk

def read_iff_file(file_path):
    # Open the IFF file in binary mode
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        # Read the ID of the first chunk
        id = file.read(4)
        
        while id != b'\0\xff\xff\0':
            # Get the size of the current chunk
            chunk_size = int.from_bytes(file.read(4), byteorder='big')
            
            # Read the data of the current chunk
            chunk_data = file.read(chunk_size)
            
            # Process or extract the data as needed
            
            # Move to the next chunk ID and size
            file.seek(chunk_size + 8, os.SEEK_CUR)
            
            # Read the ID of the next chunk
            id = file.read(4)

# Example usage
read_iff_file('example.iff')
```

### Example 2: Extracting IFF Image File (using a fictional `chunk` module)

Again, assume we have a fictional `chunk` module for handling IFF files.

```python
import chunk

def read_iff_image(file_path):
    # Open the IFF file in binary mode
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        # Read the ID of the first chunk
        id = file.read(4)
        
        while id != b'\0\xff\xff\0':
            # Get the size of the current chunk
            chunk_size = int.from_bytes(file.read(4), byteorder='big')
            
            if id == b'FORM':  # This is a common chunk ID for IFF files
                # Extract and process the FORM chunk
                form_type = file.read(4).decode('ascii')
                
                print(f"Found FORM: {form_type}")
                
                # Move to the next chunk ID and size
                file.seek(chunk_size + 8, os.SEEK_CUR)
                
                # Read the ID of the next chunk
                id = file.read(4)
            
            elif id == b'DSCS':  # This is a common chunk ID for IFF files
                # Extract and process the DSCS chunk (display specification)
                description_size = int.from_bytes(file.read(4), byteorder='big')
                
                if description_size > 0:
                    description = file.read(description_size).decode('ascii')
                    print(f"Found DSCS: {description}")
                
                # Move to the next chunk ID and size
                file.seek(chunk_size + 8, os.SEEK_CUR)
                
                # Read the ID of the next chunk
                id = file.read(4)
            
            else:
                # Skip unsupported chunks
                file.seek(chunk_size, os.SEEK_CUR)
            
            # Continue reading chunks
            id = file.read(4)

# Example usage
read_iff_image('example.iff')
```

### Notes:

1. **Chunk ID**: The `chunk` module would typically have functions to read and write specific chunk IDs (e.g., `FORM`, `DSCS` for audio/image files).
2. **Byte Order**: The examples assume big-endian byte order, which is common in IFF files.
3. **Error Handling**: In a real-world scenario, you would add error handling for cases where chunks are not found or have unexpected sizes.

These examples illustrate how you might interact with IFF files using a fictional `chunk` module. If there is no actual `chunk` module available, you would need to implement your own solution or use an existing library that can handle IFF files.
